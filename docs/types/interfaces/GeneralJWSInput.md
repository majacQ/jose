General JWS definition for verify function inputs, allows payload as [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) for
detached signature validation.

## Properties

### payload

â€¢ **payload**: `string` \| [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array)

The "payload" member MUST be present and contain the value BASE64URL(JWS Payload). When when
JWS Unencoded Payload ([RFC7797](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7797)) "b64": false is
used the value passed may also be a [Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array).

***

### signatures

â€¢ **signatures**: [`Omit`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys)\<[`FlattenedJWSInput`](FlattenedJWSInput.md), `"payload"`\>[]

The "signatures" member value MUST be an array of JSON objects. Each object represents a
signature or MAC over the JWS Payload and the JWS Protected Header.
